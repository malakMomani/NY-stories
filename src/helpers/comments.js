The actual cause in this case is gillnetting and gillnetting is a global problem that goes hand in hand with global fisheries mismanagement.Stuff like this needs an international force like the UN to try to reign in corporate interests, government disinterest and personal ignorance.It could also provide alternate ways or supplements to locals to survive.Alternatively make the violators stop to save a species.David blogs at InconvenientNews.Net.",

        commentBody: "I use the roundabouts in Carmel regularly. There is considerable idling at certain ones because they just can’t handle the traffic… cars are backed up waiting to enter the roundabout. And please take the rah rah Carmel with a grain of salt. It is still car centric with no public transportation at all. Brainard is a king with multiple shady dealings associated with him. And Carmel remains a (mostly) conservative, white suburb that feeds Indianapolis with workers but doesn’t contribute anything whatsoever to improving Indianapolis. It is the original white flight suburb.",
